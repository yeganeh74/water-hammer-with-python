calculating water hammer pressure in pipes with python
This is a code to calculate the pressure caused by water hammer in pipes. You can find the hydraulic equations of the water hammer in the hydraulic books of pipes. This code takes the necessary information from the user and presents the maximum pressure due to the water hammer, as well as the pressure in the different flow rates and closing times of the valve in that pipe in a table. The calculation outputs are available in the form of graphs and Excel tables
